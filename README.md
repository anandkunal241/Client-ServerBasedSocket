# Client-ServerBasedSocket

A simple client to client chat using server as a media implemented using java socket programming and multithreading on Netbeans platform.

Two ways to run this application : 

NOTE :  Make your system as server or update the ip of server to see the proper working of the application

1) RUNNING ON LOCALHOST :  
	
	We need to run only one homepage and enter the ip as "localhost" and port number as 5400 then two chat pages will be created and we can share messages, pics, and videos.

2) RUNNING ON TWO DIFFERENT HOSTS : 
	
	We need to run two homepages one on each hosts then any one can be used to create connection and then start chatting.


														Thanks
